# Versioning .NET Core Web API

This project demonstrates how to implement versioning in a .NET Core Web API, allowing for the maintenance of multiple API versions and smooth migration between them.

## Description

The Versioning .NET Core Web API project showcases the implementation of API versioning in a .NET Core application. It includes functionalities such as:

- **Versioning Strategies**: Implementing various versioning strategies (e.g., URI-based, query string-based, header-based).
- **Maintaining Multiple Versions**: Managing and maintaining multiple API versions concurrently.
- **Migration Support**: Ensuring smooth transition and deprecation of older API versions.

## Features

- **API Versioning**: Implementing multiple versions of APIs.
- **Versioning Strategies**: Utilizing different versioning strategies for APIs.
- **Deprecation and Migration**: Managing the deprecation and migration process for older versions.
- **Documentation**: Providing clear documentation on API versioning and changes.
